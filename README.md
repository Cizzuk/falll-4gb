# FALLLL for GB

This is a Game Boy port of my old action game [FALLLL](https://cizzuk.net/projects/falll/).

Developed using [GBDK](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020).

## Guide

### Title

Select an item using SELECT or Up/Down buttons, and confirm with START, A, or B.

- Select "START" to begin the game.

- Select "CHANGE" to switch between Normal Mode and Dog Mode. Dog Mode features a wider player character and is slightly more difficult.

### Gameplay

Avoid the leaves approaching from the bottom of the screen using the Left/Right buttons.

Leaves appear at random locations once every second, and their speed increases with your score.

Sometimes, apples and bombs will appear. Collecting an apple restores one life. Hitting a bomb results in losing all lives.

If your lives reach zero, it's game over. Press START, SELECT, A, or B to return to the title screen.
